- Class: text
  Output: R is an object-oriented programming language.  From a computer 
    science perspective, this has a technical meaning.

- Class: text
  Output: From a practical perspective, this means that R can represent 
    data in very complex ways, from a simple table of locations and temperatures, 
    to complete genome-scale experiments in the life sciences.

- Class: text
  Output: Given that R generally stores these objects in memory, these 
    objects can accumulate making R a real memory hog.  Try to remember 
    this as you progress with R.
    NOTE - WHEN I USE THE TERM MEMORY, I AM NOT REFERRING TO DISK STORAGE.  
    I AM REFERRING TO THE RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY (RAM) THAT YOUR COMPUTER 
    USES TO COMPLETE CALCULATIONS AND OTHER PROCESSES.

- Class: text
  Output: In contrast, Unix programs, while often memory intensive, process 
    data from files, and save the result to new files.

- Class: text
  Output: How do you determine the R objects that you have in memory?

- Class: text
  Output: The 'ls()' function will list the objects that you have in memory.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: When you started this lesson, three objects were created.  Enter 
    'ls()' to list these objects in the Console.
  CorrectAnswer: ls()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='ls()')
  Hint: Enter 'ls()' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: You see the names of three objects in the Console, 'ar.study', 
    'ar.tissue', and 'ar.value'.

- Class: text
  Output: You can also view the objects in the Environment pane in the 
    upper right of RStudio.  By default, the Environment pane has a List 
    view.  In this view, you get the name of the object followed by some 
    information about the object.

- Class: text
  Output: You can change from List view to Grid view by clicking on the 
    drop down menu in the upper right corner of the Environment window.  
    Select Grid view now.

- Class: text
  Output: The Grid view provides a more structured view of the objects and 
    provides Type, Length, Size and Value for each object.  Each of these 
    can also be accessed with functions, which is especially important if 
    you program with R.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'class(ar.study)' to get the Class for the object 'ar.study'. 
  CorrectAnswer: class(ar.study)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='class(ar.study)')
  Hint: Enter 'class(ar.study)' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: The Class for 'ar.study' is 'character'.  RStudio displays this 
    as Type which is confusing because, while Type is similar to Class, it 
    has a slightly different meaning.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: So what is an object of class 'character'?  Enter '?character' 
    to go to the appropriate help page. 
  CorrectAnswer: ?character
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='?character')
  Hint: Enter '?character' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: The object 'ar.study' is a character vector.  The help page shows 
    you how to use the function 'character()' to make a character vector, 
    but there are many other ways to produce a character vector.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: More general information is found on the vector help page.  Enter 
    '?vector'.
  CorrectAnswer: ?vector
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='?vector')
  Hint: Enter '?vector' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: The most basic object in R is the vector.  A vector 
    is a linear (one-dimensional) collection of values all of the same data 
    type.  The most common classes or modes of vector are character, numeric, 
    integer, and logical.

- Class: text
  Output: In this lesson, you will work with three classes of vector, character, 
    numeric and logical.  You will also work with factors, an object that 
    is derived from a character vector, and can be manipulated much like a
    vector.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You can determine the number of values stored in a vector with 
    the 'length()' function.  Enter 'length(ar.study)' to determine the 
    number of values stored in 'ar.study'.
  CorrectAnswer: length(ar.study)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='length(ar.study)')
  Hint: Enter 'length(ar.study)' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: You should find that the length of 'ar.study' is 30.  This vector 
    is small enough that you can display the contents in the Console.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'ar.study' to display the contents of this vector.
  CorrectAnswer: ar.study
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='ar.study')
  Hint: Enter 'ar.study' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: You should see 30 character strings describing The Cancer Genome 
    Atlas cancer studies.  Each string should be preceded by an integer 
    in square brackets.  This integer gives you the index or position for 
    that character string in the vector.

- Class: text
  Output: The square brackets, '[]', are the extraction operator for R.  
    They allow you to select specific elements from R objects.  The process 
    of extracting specific elements or values from data objects is called indexing.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Display the tenth value in 'ar.study' by entering 'ar.study[10]'.
  CorrectAnswer: ar.study[10]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='ar.study[10]')
  Hint: Enter 'ar.study[10]' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: You are not limited to a single integer for extraction.  You can 
    create a vector and use it to index another vector.

- Class: text
  Output: We will use the combine function, 'c()', to create a vector to 
    extract specific information from 'ar.study'.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Go to the help page for 'c()' by entering '?c'.
  CorrectAnswer: ?c
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='?c')
  Hint: Enter '?c' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: The combine function has two arguments, '...' and 'recursive'  
    It is very unlikely that you will ever need to set 'recursive=TRUE' because 
    it combines all elements in a list to a vector.  This operation is rarely 
    necessary.

- Class: text
  Output: The '...', 'three dots' or, more properly, 'ellipsis' argument allows 
    a function to accept a variable number of arguments.  This makes perfect 
    sense for 'c()' because it allows a user to combine values to make a vector 
    of almost any length (there is an upper limit).

- Class: text
  Output: Remember, vectors must contain data of the same type.  If you try 
    to combine data of different types into a vector, they will be converted 
    to the best compatible common type.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Try to generate a vector of mixed data types by entering 
    'c(1, 1.1, TRUE, "maybe")'.
  CorrectAnswer: c(1, 1.1, TRUE, "maybe")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='c(1, 1.1, TRUE, "maybe")')
  Hint: Enter 'c(1, 1.1, TRUE, "maybe")' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: The displayed vector has quotes around every value indicating that 
    this is a character vector.

- Class: text
  Output: Now, we are ready to make an integer vector to index 'ar.study'.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'my.index <- c(1, 3, 7, 13)' to create a vector that can be 
    used to extract the values at positions 1, 3, 7 and 13 from a vector.
  CorrectAnswer: my.index <- c(1, 3, 7, 13)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='my.index <- c(1, 3, 7, 13)')
  Hint: Enter 'my.index <- c(1, 3, 7, 13)' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Display values at positions 1, 3, 7 and 13 of 'ar.value' by entering 
    'ar.value[my.index]'.
  CorrectAnswer: ar.value[my.index]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='ar.value[my.index]')
  Hint: Enter 'ar.value[my.index]' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: You can also omit specific values from a vector by passing a 
    negative index.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Omit values 1, 3, 7 and 13 from 'ar.value' by entering 
    'ar.value[-my.index]'.
  CorrectAnswer: ar.value[-my.index]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='ar.value[-my.index]')
  Hint: Enter 'ar.value[-my.index]' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: You can extract values in any order that you wish.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Extract values 30 and 1 from 'ar.value' by entering 'ar.value[c(30, 1)]'.
  CorrectAnswer: ar.value[c(30, 1)]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='ar.value[c(30, 1)]')
  Hint: Enter 'ar.value[c(30, 1)]' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: Be careful when extracting data by indexing because you can try 
    to extract data that does not exist!

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Try to extract the value at position 50 in 'ar.value' by entering 
    'ar.value[50]'..
  CorrectAnswer: ar.value[50]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='ar.value[50]')
  Hint: Enter 'ar.value[50]' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: This returns the special value, 'NA', for Not Available or Missing 
    Values because there are only 30 values in 'ar.value'.

- Class: text
  Output: Another important point about character vectors.  Do not confuse 
    the length of a character vector with the number of characters in each 
    character string in that vector.

- Class: text
  Output: You can determine the number of characters in a character string 
    with the 'nchar()' function.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Determine the number of characters in the tenth value of 'ar.study' 
    by entering 'nchar(ar.study[10])'.
  CorrectAnswer: nchar(ar.study[10])
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='nchar(ar.study[10])')
  Hint: Enter 'ar.study[10]' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: On great feature of vectors in R is that many functions are vectorized, 
    they can accept a vector as input and return a vector as output.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Determine the number of characters for every value in 'ar.study' 
    by entering 'nchar(ar.study)'.
  CorrectAnswer: nchar(ar.study)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='nchar(ar.study)')
  Hint: Enter 'nchar(ar.study)' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: You should see 30 integer values ranging from 27 to 84.

- Class: text
  Output: We will use 'ar.study' again later.  Let us move on to the other 
    objects.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Determine the class of 'ar.value' by entering 'class(ar.value)'.
  CorrectAnswer: class(ar.value)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='class(ar.value)')
  Hint: Enter 'class(ar.value)' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: The object 'ar.value' is a numeric vector that contains the median 
    expression values for the AR gene in each TCGA cancer study.  This expression 
    value is determined by a TCGA pipeline.  It is an absolute measure of 
    expression, not a fold-change.  However, it has been log2 transformed.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You can display the data by entering 'ar.value' in the Console.
  CorrectAnswer: ar.value
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='ar.value')
  Hint: Enter 'ar.value' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: This gives us some impression of the data, e.g. it ranges from 
    roughly zero to ten, and, given that we have 8 decimel places, you might 
    assume the data is quite precise (definitely not true).

- Class: text
  Output: When I work with a quantitative variable, I try to do a bit of 
    data exploration.  R has many functions to facilitate this.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Get summary statistics by entering 'summary(ar.value)'.
  CorrectAnswer: summary(ar.value)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='summary(ar.value)')
  Hint: Enter 'summary(ar.value)' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: The function 'summary()' provides a good deal of information, 
    including the minimum and maximum values, as well as the mean and median.  

- Class: text
  Output: The 'min()', 'max()', 'mean()' and 'median()' functions can also 
    be used to calculate these summary statistics.

- Class: text
  Output: Use caution with the 'summary()' function because it is intended 
    to provide an easy to comprehend summary of the data.  As such, it is 
    not always precise because, by default, it limits the number of decimel 
    places it will display!

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Get a more precise value for the mean of 'ar.value' by entering 
    'mean(ar.value)'.
  CorrectAnswer: mean(ar.value)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mean(ar.value)')
  Hint: Enter 'mean(ar.value)' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: The summary of 'ar.value' suggests that the mean is 3.94200, whereas 
    the function 'mean()' indicates that it is 3.941892.  In fact, neither are 
    correct.  There can be a difference between the way that R displays data 
    and how it stores data.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Create a variable called 'ar.mean' that is the mean of 'ar.value' 
    by entering 'ar.mean <- mean(ar.value)'.
  CorrectAnswer: ar.mean <- mean(ar.value)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='ar.mean <- mean(ar.value)')
  Hint: Enter 'ar.mean <- mean(ar.value)' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Display the value of 'ar.mean' by entering 'ar.mean'.
  CorrectAnswer: ar.mean
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='ar.mean')
  Hint: Enter 'ar.mean' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: Again, the displayed value is given to 7 digits.  However, what 
    is the actual value stored as 'ar.mean'?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Display the value of 'ar.mean' to the maximum number of digits 
    by entering 'print(ar.mean, digits=22)'.
  CorrectAnswer: print(ar.mean, digits=22)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='print(ar.mean, digits=22)')
  Hint: Enter 'ar.mean' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: This example illustrates that you need to use caution with 
    numeric values when programming with R.  Values will be rounded for 
    display purposes, but they may be stored to many more digits!

- Class: text
  Output: Back to the exploration of 'ar.value'.  We have summary statistics, 
    but it is always a good idea to visualize data.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Make a simple plot of 'ar.value' by entering 'plot(ar.value)'.
  CorrectAnswer: plot(ar.value)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plot(ar.value)')
  Hint: Enter 'plot(ar.value)' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: The function 'plot()' is generic R function that has many different 
    methods.  What this means is that the output of 'plot()' will depend on 
    the class of the input object.

- Class: text
  Output: We passed only the numeric vector 'ar.value' to 'plot()'.  By 
    default, R will use 'ar.value' as the dependent variable, and the position 
    or index in the vector as x variable.

- Class: text
  Output: This plot is not particularly informative, and we would need to 
    play with the dozens of arguments and parameters that can be used with 
    'plot()' to produce something better.

- Class: text
  Output: A dot chart is a good way to plot this data.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Go to the help page for 'dotchart()' by entering '?dotchart'.
  CorrectAnswer: ?dotchart
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='?dotchart')
  Hint: Enter '?dotchart' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: With 'dotchart()' we can easily pass labels for 'ar.value' with the 
    label argument.  We have these is the vector, 'ar.study'.  However, the 
    names of the cancer studies are quite long so we will use the function 
    'substr()' to produce shorter substrings of 'ar.study'.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Make a new character vector of labels by entering 'ar.labels <- 
    substr(ar.study, start=1, stop=15)'.
  CorrectAnswer: ar.labels <- substr(ar.study, start=1, stop=15)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='ar.labels <- substr(ar.study, start=1, stop=15)')
  Hint: Enter 'ar.labels <- substr(ar.study, start=1, stop=15)' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Produce a labeled dot chart by entering 'dotchart(x=ar.value, 
    labels=ar.labels, main="AR Gene Expression", cex=0.8)'.
  CorrectAnswer: dotchart(x=ar.value, labels=ar.labels, main="AR Gene Expression", cex=0.8)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='dotchart(x=ar.value, labels=ar.labels, main="AR Gene Expression", cex=0.8)')
  Hint: Enter 'dotchart(x=ar.value, labels=ar.labels, main="AR Gene Expression", cex=0.8)' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: We now have a clearly labeled plot.  The argument 'cex=0.8' was 
    passed so that the plot labels are a little smaller than the default.  
    However, depending on the size of your display, the labels may overlap.  
    You can try a smaller value for 'cex' to adjust this.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Make a new dot chart with smaller labels by entering 
    'dotchart(x=ar.value, labels=ar.labels, main="AR Gene Expression", cex=0.7)'.
  CorrectAnswer: dotchart(x=ar.value, labels=ar.labels, main="AR Gene Expression", cex=0.7)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='dotchart(x=ar.value, labels=ar.labels, main="AR Gene Expression", cex=0.7)')
  Hint: Enter 'dotchart(x=ar.value, labels=ar.labels, main="AR Gene Expression", cex=0.7)' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: If the labels on the chart still overlap, you can use Zoom in the 
    upper left of the Plots pane.  This will send the plot to a separate 
    window that you can resize as needed.

- Class: text
  Output: When generating graphics in R for publication or sharing, you will 
    send the results directly to a file.  The Plots panel and Export features 
    are useful only for generating draft figures.  For example, our dot chart 
    could still benefit from additional information.

- Class: text
  Output: We can group the cancer studies by tissue of origin using the object 
    'ar.tissue', but, first, we need to know more about this object.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter the expression that will determine the class of 'ar.tissue'.
  CorrectAnswer: class(ar.tissue)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='class(ar.tissue)')
  Hint: Enter 'class(ar.tissue)' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Go to the help page for 'factor()' by entering '?factor'.
  CorrectAnswer: ?factor
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='?factor')
  Hint: Enter '?factor' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: A factor is a class of object used to store categorical data.  
    Categorical data is characterized by having only a limited number of 
    valid values or levels.

- Class: text
  Output: Simple examples include undergraduate student standing (freshman, 
    sophomore, junior, or senior) or state of primary residence.

- Class: text
  Output: The purpose of factors or categorical data is that allows you to 
    group data easily.  In our example, we want to group the cancer studies 
    by tissue of origin.

- Class: text
  Output: The most common way to create an object of class factor is with 
    the 'as.factor()' function on an existing vector (usually of class character).

- Class: text
  Output: However, it only makes sense to convert a vector to a factor if 
    you have clear categories in the data.  For example, it does not make 
    sense to convert 'ar.study' to a factor because each study is a unique 
    value.

- Class: text
  Output: Factors behave very much like vectors, but there are important 
    differences.  For example, compare the result when you display the contents 
    of 'ar.study' and 'ar.tissue'.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'ar.study' to display its values in the console.
  CorrectAnswer: ar.study
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='ar.study')
  Hint: Enter 'ar.study' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'ar.tissue' to display its values in the console.
  CorrectAnswer: ar.tissue
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='ar.tissue')
  Hint: Enter 'ar.tissue' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: Note that the values of 'ar.study' are flanked by quotes.  This 
    is always true for character strings.  

- Class: text
  Output: The values for 'ar.tissue' are not flanked by quotes.  In addition, 
    the levels for 'ar.tissue' are listed.  The levels for a factor are the 
    only allowed values.

- Class: text
  Output: Now that we understand 'ar.tissue' we can it as a grouping variable 
    in our dotchart.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Produce a dot chart by entering 'dotchart(x=ar.value, 
    labels=ar.labels, main="AR Gene Expression", cex=0.8, groups=ar.tissue, xlab="RNAseq RSEM Value (log2)")'.
  CorrectAnswer: dotchart(x=ar.value, labels=ar.labels, main="AR Gene Expression", cex=0.8, groups=ar.tissue, xlab="RNAseq RSEM Value (log2)")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='dotchart(x=ar.value, labels=ar.labels, main="AR Gene Expression", cex=0.8, groups=ar.tissue, xlab="RNAseq RSEM Value (log2)")')
  Hint: Enter 'dotchart(x=ar.value, labels=ar.labels, main="AR Gene Expression", cex=0.8, groups=ar.tissue, xlab="RNAseq RSEM Value (log2)")' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: This chart provides a more organized view of the results using 
    three separate vectors or factors.  For example, we can see that some 
    of the urologic cancers have elevated AR expression while this is not 
    true of the hematologic cancers.

- Class: text
  Output: There are two classes or modes of vector that we have not covered.  
    An integer vector is similiar to a numeric vector in most respects, but 
    it can contain only whole numbers.  Integer vectors are stored more compactly 
    than numeric vectors so it makes sense to use them when you can.

- Class: text
  Output: A logical vector can only contain the values TRUE, FALSE and NA.  
    T and F are generally equivalent to TRUE and FALSE, although not on some 
    computers.

- Class: text
  Output: Logical vectors are usually created as a result of a relational 
    operations or Boolean expressions.  Some functions such as 'identical()' 
    and 'is.na()' produce logical vectors.

- Class: text
  Output: In addition, integer and numeric values have logical equivalents, 
    and vice versa.  Zero is equivalent to FALSE.  Any non-zero number is 
    equivalent to TRUE.  TRUE is equivalent to one.  Keep this in mind because 
    it can become handy.  Here are two examples to illustrate.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'sum(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE))'.
  CorrectAnswer: sum(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sum(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE))')
  Hint: Enter 'sum(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE))' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'as.logical(c(1, 10.1, -200, 0, 0))'.
  CorrectAnswer: as.logical(c(1, 10.1, -200, 0, 0))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='as.logical(c(1, 10.1, -200, 0, 0))')
  Hint: Enter 'as.logical(c(1, 10.1, -200, 0, 0))' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: You can use a logical vector to index the cancer studies based on 
    AR expression level.  High AR expression can be defined as any study 
    where AR expression is 6 or greater.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Create a logical vector by entering 'high.ar <- ar.value >= 6'.
  CorrectAnswer: high.ar <- ar.value >= 6
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='high.ar <- ar.value >= 6')
  Hint: Enter 'high.ar <- ar.value >= 6' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Display the logical vector by entering 'high.ar'.
  CorrectAnswer: high.ar
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='high.ar')
  Hint: Enter 'high.ar' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: You should see that we now have a TRUE or FALSE evaluation of the 
    'ar.value >= 6' for every cancer study.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Display the cancer studies with high AR expression by entering 
    'ar.study[high.ar]'.
  CorrectAnswer: ar.study[high.ar]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='ar.study[high.ar]')
  Hint: Enter 'ar.study[high.ar]' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: We can also explore the relationship between high AR expression 
    and tissue of origin with the 'table()' function.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'table(ar.tissue, high.ar)' to generate the table.
  CorrectAnswer: table(ar.tissue, high.ar)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='table(ar.tissue, high.ar)')
  Hint: Enter 'table(ar.tissue, high.ar)' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: This table suggests that high AR expression is only associated 
    with cancers from certain tissues.  However, the data is not sufficient 
    to make any strong assertions.

- Class: text
  Output: An important point of this lesson is that each of the objects 
    that we used in this lesson are all in the same order, i.e. the eleventh 
    value in each object contains data for the same cancer study.

- Class: text
  Output: Certain functions such as 'sort()' and 'order()' can change the 
    position of values in a vector.  If done carelessly, your vectors are 
    no longer aligned.

- Class: text
  Output: This potential problem points to the need for an object that can 
    combines a group of aligned vectors.  This class of object is called a

  Output: Enter the expression that will extract the values at positions 
    5, 25, and 15 from 'ar.study' in that order!
  CorrectAnswer: ar.study[c(5, 25, 15)]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='ar.study[c(5, 25, 15)]')
  Hint: You need to use 'c()' and '[]'.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: How long is the vector that results from 'ar.value[-c(1, 11, 21, 31)]'?
  CorrectAnswer: 27
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=27)
  Hint: What happens if you index outside the actual positions in a vector?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Not all vectors are sensible candidates for factors.  
    What is the maximum value in this table - 'table(as.factor(ar.study))'?
  CorrectAnswer: 1
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='1')
  Hint: Use 'table()' to determine the answer.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the result for this expression 'sum(ar.tissue=="cns")'?
  CorrectAnswer: 2
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='2')
  Hint: The double equals, '==', is the relational operator for equality.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Not all vectors are sensible candidates for factors.  
    What is the maximum value in this table - 'table(as.factor(ar.study))'?
  CorrectAnswer: 1
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='1')
  Hint: Use 'table()' to determine the answer.

- Class: text
  Output: You have completed lesson02.  Now you need to write the completion 
    key to "lessonKeys.txt".  Since the file already exists and contains 
    information we need to preserve, we will use 'append=TRUE' as an argument.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'write("Lesson02_RGKPS", file="~/BigTapSwirl/lessonKeys.txt", append=TRUE)' to append 
    the key for lesson02 to the file "lessonKeys.txt".
  CorrectAnswer: write("Lesson02_RGKPS", file="~/BigTapSwirl/lessonKeys.txt", append=TRUE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='write("Lesson02_RGKPS", file="~/BigTapSwirl/lessonKeys.txt", append=TRUE)')
  Hint: Enter 'write("Lesson02_RGKPS", file="~/BigTapSwirl/lessonKeys.txt", append=TRUE)' omitting the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: If you could not create "lessonKeys.txt", please copy and paste the 
    key into a Word or text document.
