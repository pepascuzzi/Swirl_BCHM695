  Lesson: Lesson03_Dataframes
  Author: Pete E. Pascuzzi
  Type: Standard
  Organization: Purdue University
  Version: 2.4.2

- Class: text
  Output: In this lesson, you will be introduced to 'data frames', possibly 
    the most important object class in R.  

- Class: text
  Output: A data frame is comprised of 'vectors', so this lesson will build 
    on what you learned in Lesson 02.  

- Class: text
  Output: In this lesson, you will gain experience with R functions such 
    as 'head()', 'tail()', 'dim()', and 'summary()' that allow you to explore 
    the size and data types stored in a 'data frame'.

- Class: text
  Output: You will learn how to extract values from a 'data frame' using 
    the operators '[]', '[[]]' and '$'.

- Class: text
  Output: You will learn how to create indexing variables that allow you 
    to extract subsets from a 'data frame'.

- Class: text
  Output: You will learn how to identify and convert potential 'factors' 
    from character or numeric vectors using 'as.factor()' or 'factor()'.

- Class: text
  Output: You will learn how to use 'table()' to tabulate or cross-tabulate 
    one or more 'factors'.

- Class: text
  Output: You will learn how to use 'tapply()' to summarize specific variables 
    grouped by a 'factor'.

- Class: text
  Output: You will learn how to use 'boxplot()' to create a visual summary 
    of a numeric variable grouped by a 'factor'.

- Class: text
  Output: You will learn how to use 'write.table()' and 'read.delim()' to 
    create a data frame from a tab-delimited text file.

- Class: text
  Output: In Lesson02_Vectors, you worked with numeric and character 
    vectors and a similar object called a factor.  

- Class: text
  Output: You were able to use these objects to create plots and tables 
    to explore the data.  This was possible because the data in these objects 
    was "parallel", i.e. the vectors were ordered so that data at each position 
    applies to the same sample or record.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'vectorPlot()' to generate a figure that illustrates 
    "parallel" vectors.  Make sure your Plots Plane is selected and large 
    enough to fit the plot.
  CorrectAnswer: vectorPlot()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='vectorPlot()')
  Hint: Enter 'vectorPlot()' omitting the quotes.  Make sure your plot 
    pane is large enough for the figure.

- Class: text
  Output: However, you can sort or reorder vectors in R, so what happens if 
    your values are no longer "parallel"?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'vectorPlotScrambled()' to generate a figure that illustrates 
    "scrambled" vectors.
  CorrectAnswer: vectorPlotScrambled()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='vectorPlotScrambled()')
  Hint: Enter 'vectorPlotScrambled()' omitting the quotes.  Make sure your plot 
    pane is large enough for the figure.  

- Class: text
  Output: As shown in the figure, the positions in vector "B" and "C" are 
    no longer "parallel" with vector "A".  Any analysis that uses data in 
    vector "B" or "C" will not be accurate.

- Class: text
  Output: So, how can you store data where multiple variables are stored for 
    each sample or record?  The answer is a 'data frame', a 'list' of "parallel" 
    'vectors' that is similar to an Excel worksheet in many respects.

- Class: text
  Output: In a 'data frame', the 'vectors' are coupled so that the data is 
    "parallel" and cannot be easily scrambled.  

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'dataframePlot()' to generate a figure that illustrates 
    the linked 'vectors' in a 'data frame'.
  CorrectAnswer: dataframePlot()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='dataframePlot()')
  Hint: Enter 'dataframePlot()' omitting the quotes.  Make sure your plot 
    pane is large enough for the figure.

- Class: text
  Output: If you sort or reorder the values in a 'data frame', all 'vectors' 
    in that 'data frame' are also sorted or reordered to avoid any errors 
    during analysis.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'dataframeSortPlot()' to generate a figure that illustrates 
    how all in a data frame .
  CorrectAnswer: dataframeSortPlot()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='dataframeSortPlot()')
  Hint: Enter 'dataframeSortPlot()' omitting the quotes.  Make sure your plot 
    pane is large enough for the figure.

- Class: text
  Output: It is still possible to scramble the data in a data frame, but it 
    requires a deliberate effort.  

- Class: text
  Output: Now that you understand the need for a data frame, let's look at 
    them in more detail.

- Class: text
  Output: When you started this lesson, a data frame was read into your 
    workspace from a text file that was bundled with this swirl lesson.  

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'ls()' to list the objects in your workspace.  
  CorrectAnswer: ls()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='ls()')
  Hint: Enter 'ls()' omitting the quotes.  

- Class: text
  Output: You should see five objects, the four functions that you used to 
    generate figures, and an object named 'ar.exp'.  You can 
    determine the 'class' of this objects with the 'class()' function.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'class(ar.exp)' to determine the class of 'ar.exp'.  
  CorrectAnswer: class(ar.exp)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='class(ar.exp)')
  Hint: Enter 'class(ar.exp)' omitting the quotes.  

- Class: text
  Output: You should see the result 'data.frame' in the Console.  

- Class: text
  Output: You can use the 'head()' function to see the first few rows of 
    either data frame.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'head(ar.exp, n=10)' to see the first ten rows of 'ar.exp'.  
  CorrectAnswer: head(ar.exp, n=10)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='head(ar.exp, n=10)')
  Hint: Enter 'head(ar.exp, n=10)' omitting the quotes.  

- Class: text
  Output: It is generally a good idea to look at the last few rows of a 
    data frame as well.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'tail(ar.exp, n=10)' to see the first ten rows of 'ar.exp'.  
  CorrectAnswer: tail(ar.exp, n=10)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='tail(ar.exp, n=10)')
  Hint: Enter 'tail(ar.exp, n=10)' omitting the quotes.  

- Class: text
  Output: For both 'head()' and 'tail()', you should see ten rows of data 
    for 6 columns with each column containing a separate variable.  

- Class: text
  Output: This data was downloaded from cBioPortal and contains data for 
    about 9100 samples from multiple cancer studies.  

- Class: text
  Output: You can determine the exact size of a data frame with the 'dim()' 
    function.  

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'dim(ar.exp)' to determine the number of rows and columns 
    in 'ar.exo'.  
  CorrectAnswer: dim(ar.exp)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='dim(ar.exp)')
  Hint: Enter 'dim(ar.expt)' omitting the quotes.  

- Class: text
  Output: The dimensions of an object are always given with rows first then 
    columns.  This data set has 9121 rows and six columns.  Each row corresponds 
    to one sample, and each column to one variable.

- Class: text
  Output: This data set is "rectangular" because there is an entry in every 
    column for each sample.

- Class: text
  Output: You can use the function 'summary()' to get a quick summary of each 
    column or variable in a data frame.  Remember the issue with rounding 
    of numbers from the Vectors lesson!

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'summary(ar.exp)' to determine the number of rows and columns 
    in 'ar.exp'.  
  CorrectAnswer: summary(ar.exp)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='summary(ar.exp)')
  Hint: Enter 'summary(ar.exp)' omitting the quotes.  

- Class: text
  Output: This data frame contains the mutation status and the RNA seq 
    expression value for the AR gene across various TCGA cancer studies.  

- Class: text
  Output: Each column in a data frame is a vector, and the function 
    'summary()' shows that the first five variables or columns are character 
    vectors while the last column, Value, is a numeric vector.  

- Class: text
  Output: Very little information is provided for the first five columns, 
    but summary statistics are give for the 'numeric vector', Value.

- Class: text
  Output: In fact, some of the first five variables are probably better 
    represented as 'factors', categorical variables that have a limited 
    number of valid values.  

- Class: text
  Output: We can use the function 'table()' to tabulate the number of occurences 
    of particular character strings in a character vector.

- Class: text
  Output: To do this, we must "extract" a single column or vector from our data frame.  
    There are actually three valid ways to do this.  

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'help(Extract)' to go to the help page for operators that 
    allow you to extract values from various R objects.
  CorrectAnswer: help(Extract)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='help(Extract)')
  Hint: Enter 'help(Extract)' omitting the quotes.  

- Class: text
  Output: This help page is a little dense, but it does show that we can 
    use three operators for extraction, single brackets '[]', double brackets '[[]]', 
    or the dollar sign '$'.

- Class: text
  Output: Of these, the dollar sign '$' is probably the easiest to use.  
    Simply use the data frame name and the desired column name joined by 
    the dollar sign.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'head(ar.exp$Cancer.Study)' to show the first few rows of 
    the Cancer.Study column.
  CorrectAnswer: head(ar.exp$Cancer.Study)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='head(ar.exp$Cancer.Study)')
  Hint: Enter 'head(ar.exp$Cancer.Study)' omitting the quotes.  

- Class: text
  Output: You can also extract a column from a data frame with double brackets '[[]]'.  
    You simply follow the data frame name with the desired column name or number 
    enclosed by '[[]]'.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'head(ar.exp[["Cancer.Study"]])' to show the first few rows of 
    the Cancer.Study column.
  CorrectAnswer: head(ar.exp[["Cancer.Study"]])
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='head(ar.exp[["Cancer.Study"]])')
  Hint: Enter 'head(ar.exp[["Cancer.Study"]])' omitting the quotes.  

- Class: text
  Output: Extracting values with single brackets '[]' is more flexible, but 
    you must specify both rows and columns for the data frame.  Our data frame 
    does not have rownames, so we will use row numbers.  For columns, you 
    can use either the column name or the column number.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'ar.exp[1:10, "Cancer.Study"]' to show the first ten rows of 
    the Cancer.Study column.
  CorrectAnswer: ar.exp[1:10, "Cancer.Study"]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='ar.exp[1:10, "Cancer.Study"]')
  Hint: Enter 'ar.exp[1:10, "Cancer.Study"]' omitting the quotes.  

- Class: text
  Output: Now that we know how to extract a single column from a data frame, 
    we can use 'table()' to tabulate the values in the column 'Cancer.Study'.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'study.tbl <- table(ar.exp$Cancer.Study)' to tabulate the values in the 
    column 'Cancer.Study' and save as an object called 'study.tbl'.
  CorrectAnswer: study.tbl <- table(ar.exp$Cancer.Study)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='study.tbl <- table(ar.exp$Cancer.Study)')
  Hint: Enter 'study.tbl <- table(ar.exp$Cancer.Study)' omitting the quotes.  

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'study.tbl' to display the table in the Console.
  CorrectAnswer: study.tbl
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='study.tbl')
  Hint: Enter 'study.tbl' omitting the quotes.  

- Class: text
  Output: You should see the study names listed with a numeric value that 
    indicates the number of samples in that study.

- Class: text
  Output: We can use 'barchart()' to make a quick visual summary of this 
    table.  First, we can use the function 'sort()' to arrange the table 
    by decreasing sample count.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'study.tbl <- sort(study.tbl, decreasing=TRUE)' to sort 'study.tbl' 
    in decreasing order and reassign this to 'study.tbl'.  
  CorrectAnswer: study.tbl <- sort(study.tbl, decreasing=TRUE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='study.tbl <- sort(study.tbl, decreasing=TRUE)')
  Hint: Enter 'study.tbl <- sort(study.tbl, decreasing=TRUE)' omitting the quotes.  

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'study.tbl' to display the table in the Console.
  CorrectAnswer: study.tbl
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='study.tbl')
  Hint: Enter 'study.tbl' omitting the quotes.  

- Class: text
  Output: It may seem odd that we can overwrite 'study.tbl' in this way, but 
    recursive operations like this are common in computer science.  Just be 
    careful with such operations because there is no "undo" function in R.  

- Class: text
  Output: The study names are quite long.  We can make shorter labels for 
    our plot as we did in Lesson 02.  In this case, the character vector 
    that we need is the 'names' of  the sorted 'study.tbl'.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Make a new character vector of labels by entering 'study.labels <- 
    substr(names(study.tbl), start=1, stop=15)'.
  CorrectAnswer: study.labels <- substr(names(study.tbl), start=1, stop=15)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='study.labels <- substr(names(study.tbl), start=1, stop=15)')
  Hint: Enter 'study.labels <- substr(names(study.tbl), start=1, stop=15)' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'study.labels' to display the labels in the Console.
  CorrectAnswer: study.labels
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='study.labels')
  Hint: Enter 'study.labels' omitting the quotes.  

- Class: text
  Output: Now, we have everything that we need for a barplot.  If you want, 
    go to the help page for the function 'barplot()'.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Make a barplot of the study table by entering 
    'barplot(study.tbl, names.arg=study.labels, las=2, cex.names=0.8, main="Sample Count for Cancer Studies")'.
  CorrectAnswer: barplot(study.tbl, names.arg=study.labels, las=2, cex.names=0.8, main="Sample Count for Cancer Studies")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='barplot(study.tbl, names.arg=study.labels, las=2, cex.names=0.8, main="Sample Count for Cancer Studies")')
  Hint: This is a long expression, so please copy and paste to avoid typos.  

- Class: text
  Output: There are a few problems with this plot, 1) the study labels are 
    cut-off, 2) the gray bars are boring, and 3) the longest bar extends 
    beyond the y-axis,.

- Class: text
  Output: We can address the first issue by altering the margin size for 
    the plot with the 'par()' function.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Go to the help page for 'par()' by entering '?par'.
  CorrectAnswer: ?par
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='?par')
  Hint: Enter '?par' omitting the quotes.  

- Class: text
  Output: There are 72 graphical parameters that can be used to change the 
    appearance of plots.  Some of these, such as 'las', can be set when 
    you generate a plot.  Others, need to be set with the 'par()' function.  

- Class: text
  Output: One of these are 'mai' and 'mar', two parameters that can be used 
    to change margin sizes.  The first sets the margin in inches, while the 
    second specifies lines (there are 5 lines per inch).  Altering one, 
    necessarily alters the other.

- Class: text
  Output: Both 'mai' and 'mar' are set by numeric vectors in the form of 
    'c(bottom margin, left margin, top margin, right margin)'.  Once these 
    parameters are changed from the default, they are set for all subsequent 
    plot unless you change them again.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'par(mai=c(2, 1, 1, 0.5))' to change the plot margins to 
    bottom = 2, left = 1, top = 1, and right = 0.5 inches.
  CorrectAnswer: par(mai=c(2, 1, 1, 0.5))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='par(mai=c(2, 1, 1, 0.5))')
  Hint: Enter 'par(mai=c(2, 1, 1, 0.5))' omitting the quotes.  

- Class: text
  Output: To change the color of the bars, we can create a vector of colors 
    using a predefined color palette in R.  Color use in data visualizations 
    is a combination of art and science.  Here, we are simply going to use 
    the 'rainbow()' palette in R, toning down the saturation and value a bit.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'study.cols <- rainbow(n=length(study.labels), s=0.8, v=0.9)' 
    to create a character vector of color for the barplot.  
  CorrectAnswer: study.cols <- rainbow(n=length(study.labels), s=0.8, v=0.9)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='study.cols <- rainbow(n=length(study.labels), s=0.8, v=0.9)')
  Hint: Enter 'par(mai=c(2, 1, 1, 0.5))' omitting the quotes.  

- Class: text
  Output: To fix the issue of one bar extending beyond the y-axis, we need 
    to explicitly set the limits for the y-axis in the barplot with the 
    parameter 'ylim'.  

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Make a revised barplot of the study table by entering 
    'barplot(study.tbl, names.arg=study.labels, las=2, horiz=FALSE, cex.names=0.8, main="Sample Count for Cancer Studies", col=study.cols, ylim=c(0, 1200))'.
  CorrectAnswer: barplot(study.tbl, names.arg=study.labels, las=2, horiz=FALSE, cex.names=0.8, main="Sample Count for Cancer Studies", col=study.cols, ylim=c(0, 1200))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='barplot(study.tbl, names.arg=study.labels, las=2, horiz=FALSE, cex.names=0.8, main="Sample Count for Cancer Studies", col=study.cols, ylim=c(0, 1200))')
  Hint: This is a long expression, so please copy and paste to avoid typos.  

- Class: text
  Output: Now, we have a presentable barplot that summarizes the number of 
    samples in each cancer study.  In addition, we have a clear example of a
    variable that should be handled as a 'factor' and not a 'character 
    vector'.  

- Class: text
  Output: To illustrate why this is important, we can make a table of Cancer 
    Studies on a subset of samples.  As in Lesson 02, we will define high 
    AR expression as log2(Value + 0.01) >= 10 (you need to add a small constant 
    to prevent taking a log2 of zero) to generate a logical vector for 
    indexing.  The cutoff has been raised to 10 because we are looking for 
    individual samples with high values, not cancer studies with high mean 
    values.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'ar.exp$Value <- log2(ar.exp$Value + 0.01)' to log2 transform 
    the AR expression values.
  CorrectAnswer: ar.exp$Value <- log2(ar.exp$Value + 0.01)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='ar.exp$Value <- log2(ar.exp$Value + 0.01)')
  Hint: Enter 'ar.exp$Value <- log2(ar.exp$Value + 0.01)' omitting the quotes.  

- Class: text
  Output: The original expression values were given to four decimal places, 
    so we will do the same with the log2 transformed data.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'ar.exp$Value <- round(ar.exp$Value, digits=4)' to log2 transform 
    the AR expression values.
  CorrectAnswer: ar.exp$Value <- round(ar.exp$Value, digits=4)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='ar.exp$Value <- round(ar.exp$Value, digits=4)')
  Hint: Enter 'ar.exp$Value <- round(ar.exp$Value, digits=4)' omitting the quotes.  

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'summary(ar.exp$Value)' to log2 transform 
    the AR expression values.
  CorrectAnswer: summary(ar.exp$Value)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='summary(ar.exp$Value)')
  Hint: Enter 'summary(ar.exp$Value)' omitting the quotes.  

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'high.ar <- ar.exp$Value >= 10' to generate a logical 
    vector that can be used to extract samples with high AR expression.  
  CorrectAnswer: high.ar <- ar.exp$Value >= 10
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='high.ar <- ar.exp$Value >= 10')
  Hint: Enter 'high.ar <- ar.exp$Value >= 10' omitting the quotes.  

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'high.ar.study.tbl <- table(ar.exp$Cancer.Study[high.ar])' to 
    determine the high expression sample count for cancer studies.
  CorrectAnswer: high.ar.study.tbl <- table(ar.exp$Cancer.Study[high.ar])
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='high.ar.study.tbl <- table(ar.exp$Cancer.Study[high.ar])')
  Hint: Enter 'high.ar.study.tbl <- table(ar.exp$Cancer.Study[high.ar])' omitting the quotes.  

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'high.ar.study.tbl' to display the table.  
  CorrectAnswer: high.ar.study.tbl
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='high.ar.study.tbl')
  Hint: Enter 'high.ar.study.tbl' omitting the quotes.  

- Class: text
  Output: Note that this table is much smaller than the complete table, and 
    only six out of thirty studies are represented.  This creates a potential 
    problem for analysis because the table is essentially incomplete.

- Class: text
  Output: We may know that there are zero high expression samples in the 
    other studies, but if we share the result, others may not realize that 
    the other studies were even considered.

- Class: text
  Output: Converting 'ar.exp$Cancer.Study' to a factor will correct this 
    issue.  If you want a specific order to the levels (possible values) 
    in your factor, you need to explicitly define the factor with the 'factor()' 
    function.  

- Class: text
  Output: If you simply want to convert an existing character vector to a 
    factor, and alphabetical ordering of levels is fine, you can use the 
    'as.factor()' function.

- Class: text
  Output: In our case, we want the order the levels to be the same as the 
    order in the study table and barplot, in decreasing order of sample count.  
    We can use the names of 'study.tbl' to provide the levels.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'ar.exp$Cancer.Study <- factor(ar.exp$Cancer.Study, levels=names(study.tbl))' 
    to convert Cancer.Study to a factor.  
  CorrectAnswer: ar.exp$Cancer.Study <- factor(ar.exp$Cancer.Study, levels=names(study.tbl))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='ar.exp$Cancer.Study <- factor(ar.exp$Cancer.Study, levels=names(study.tbl))')
  Hint: Enter 'ar.exp$Cancer.Study <- factor(ar.exp$Cancer.Study, levels=names(study.tbl))' omitting the quotes.  

- Class: text
  Output: Now, we can revise our the study sample count table for high AR 
    expression samples and display the result.  

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'high.ar.study.tbl <- table(ar.exp$Cancer.Study[high.ar])' to 
    determine the high expression sample count for cancer studies.
  CorrectAnswer: high.ar.study.tbl <- table(ar.exp$Cancer.Study[high.ar])
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='high.ar.study.tbl <- table(ar.exp$Cancer.Study[high.ar])')
  Hint: Enter 'high.ar.study.tbl <- table(ar.exp$Cancer.Study[high.ar])' omitting the quotes.  

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'high.ar.study.tbl' to display the table.  
  CorrectAnswer: high.ar.study.tbl
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='high.ar.study.tbl')
  Hint: Enter 'high.ar.study.tbl' omitting the quotes.  

- Class: text
  Output: Now, we have a more complete picture of the distribution of high AR expressing 
    samples across the cancer studies.  

- Class: text
  Output: We can also use 'ar.exp$Cancer.Study' and 'high.ar' to tabulate 
    high AR expressing samples with respect to cancer study.  

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'table(ar.exp$Cancer.Study, high.ar)' to cross-tabulate 
    Cancer Study and high AR expressing samples.  
  CorrectAnswer: table(ar.exp$Cancer.Study, high.ar)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='table(ar.exp$Cancer.Study, high.ar)')
  Hint: Enter 'table(ar.exp$Cancer.Study, high.ar)' omitting the quotes.  

- Class: text
  Output: The function 'table()' is extremely useful, and can be used with 
    many downstream statistical tests (not covered here).  

- Class: text
  Output: In Lesson 02, 'ar.value' was a numeric vector that contained 
    the median log2-transformed expression values for AR for each cancer 
    study.  

- Class: text
  Output: The vector 'ar.value' was derived from 'ar.exp$Value' using the 
    'tapply()' function.

- Class: text
  Output: You can go to the help page for 'tapply()' but it is pretty cryptic.  
    A more concise explanation, still cryptic, is that 'tapply()' will 
    "apply" a specified function to the values in one vector that can be 
    grouped or indexed by the values in a second vector.  The mnemonic to 
    remember this is "type apply" where type refers to a grouping variable 
    or factor..  

- Class: text
  Output: As an example, we can recreate 'ar.value' from two columns in 
    'ar.exp', Value and Cancer.Study, using 'tapply()', 'log2()' and 'median()'.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'ar.value <- tapply(ar.exp$Value, INDEX=ar.exp$Cancer.Study, FUN=median)' 
    to determine the median log2 expression values for all samples in each 
    cancer study.
  CorrectAnswer: ar.value <- tapply(ar.exp$Value, INDEX=ar.exp$Cancer.Study, FUN=median)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='ar.value <- tapply(ar.exp$Value, INDEX=ar.exp$Cancer.Study, FUN=median)')
  Hint: Enter 'ar.value <- tapply(ar.exp$Value, INDEX=ar.exp$Cancer.Study, FUN=median)' omitting the quotes.  

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'ar.value' to display the data.
  CorrectAnswer: ar.value
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='ar.value')
  Hint: Enter 'ar.value' omitting the quotes.  

- Class: text
  Output: R grouped 'Value' by 'Cancer.Study' then applied the function 'median()' 
    to each group.  In the Console, you should see each cancer study followed 
    by the median expression value of AR for the samples in that study.

- Class: text
  Output: You can use almost any function with 'tapply()', even user-defined 
    functions, provided that is makes sense for the given data.  

- Class: text
  Output: In addition, the 'INDEX' vector does not need to be a 'factor' 
    but it should be a variable that is potentially a good factor.  For example, 
    it does not make sense to use 'ar.exp$Sample.Id' as an 'INDEX' because 
    the Sample Ids are unique.

- Class: text
  Output: We can visualize the median AR expression values as a barplot similar 
    to the plot of cancer study sample count.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Make a barplot of 'ar.value'  by entering 
    'barplot(ar.value, names.arg=study.labels, las=2, horiz=FALSE, cex.names=0.8, main="Median AR Expression", col=study.cols, ylim=c(0, 10))'.
  CorrectAnswer: barplot(ar.value, names.arg=study.labels, las=2, horiz=FALSE, cex.names=0.8, main="Median AR Expression", col=study.cols, ylim=c(0, 10))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='barplot(ar.value, names.arg=study.labels, las=2, horiz=FALSE, cex.names=0.8, main="Median AR Expression", col=study.cols, ylim=c(0, 10))')
  Hint: This is a long expression, so please copy and paste to avoid typos.  

- Class: text
  Output: A barplot was fine for the sample counts, but it is not very informative 
    for AR expression values because there is no sense of the variance in 
    the data.  

- Class: text
  Output: A superior plot for continuous data is a boxplot.  First, we will 
    make a boxplot of AR expression values across all cancer studies.  You 
    may want to go to the help page for 'boxplot()'.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'boxplot(ar.exp$Value)' to make a boxplot of AR expression 
    values across all cancer studies.
  CorrectAnswer: boxplot(ar.exp$Value)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='boxplot(ar.exp$Value)')
  Hint: Enter 'boxplot(ar.exp$Value)' omitting the quotes.  

- Class: text
  Output: A boxplot visualizes several important properties of a variable. The box is 
    defined by three values, the bottom edge of the box is the bottom of the 2nd 
    quartile of the data, the heavy center line is the top of the 2nd quartile, also 
    called the median value, and the top of the box is the top of the 3rd quartile. 

- Class: text
  Output: Each quartile contains 25% of the data.  Thus, 50% of the data 
    lies within the box.  The height of this box is called the Inter Quartile 
    Range (IQR).

- Class: text
  Output: The whiskers extend from the box to enclose the remaining values 
    or range of the data.  However, the whiskers will extend no more 
    than 1.5 times the IQR.  Any value beyond that range is considered a 
    possible outlier.  

- Class: text
  Output: You can adjust how far the whiskers extend with the 'range' parameter 
    to 'boxplot()'.  However, alter this default parameter only with good 
    reason.  

- Class: text
  Output: A great feature of 'boxplot()' is that, like 'tapply()', it can 
    summarize data with respect to an indexing variable or factor.  This 
    feature makes it very easy to graphically examine AR expression across 
    the cancer studies.  

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'boxplot(ar.exp$Value ~ ar.exp$Cancer.Study, names=study.labels, col=study.cols, las=2, main="AR Expression Across Cancer Studies")' to make a boxplot of AR expression 
    values across all cancer studies.
  CorrectAnswer: boxplot(ar.exp$Value ~ ar.exp$Cancer.Study, names=study.labels, col=study.cols, las=2, main="AR Expression Across Cancer Studies")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='boxplot(ar.exp$Value ~ ar.exp$Cancer.Study, names=study.labels, col=study.cols, las=2, main="AR Expression Across Cancer Studies")')
  Hint: Enter 'boxplot(ar.exp$Value ~ ar.exp$Cancer.Study, names=study.labels, col=study.cols, las=2, main="AR Expression Across Cancer Studies")' omitting the quotes.  

- Class: text
  Output: Note the formula format that was used, 'Value' ~ 'Cancer.Study'.  Read this 
    as "Value as a function of Cancer.Study" where 'Value' is the dependent variable 
    and 'Cancer.Study' is the independent variable.

- Class: text
  Output: Like 'tapply()', when supplied with a grouping variable, 'boxplot()' 
    will perform all calculations on the data after it has been split by group.  
    Thus, we have a plot comprised of 30 individual boxplots.  

- Class: text
  Output: One problem with this plot is that the cancer studies are sorted 
    by sample count, not AR expression.  We can fix this by changing the 
    order in our factor 'ar.exp$Cancer.Study' using the median expression 
    values in 'ar.value'.

- Class: text
  Output: First, sort 'ar.value' in decreasing order.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'ar.value <- sort(ar.value, decreasing=TRUE)'.
  CorrectAnswer: ar.value <- sort(ar.value, decreasing=TRUE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='ar.value <- sort(ar.value, decreasing=TRUE)')
  Hint: Enter 'ar.value <- sort(ar.value, decreasing=TRUE)' omitting the quotes.  

- Class: text
  Output: Second, redefine 'ar.exp$Value' as a 'factor' using the names 
    form 'ar.value' which list the studies in decreasing order of AR expression.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'ar.exp$Cancer.Study <- factor(ar.exp$Cancer.Study, levels=names(ar.value))'.
  CorrectAnswer: ar.exp$Cancer.Study <- factor(ar.exp$Cancer.Study, levels=names(ar.value))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='ar.exp$Cancer.Study <- factor(ar.exp$Cancer.Study, levels=names(ar.value))')
  Hint: Enter 'ar.exp$Cancer.Study <- factor(ar.exp$Cancer.Study, levels=names(ar.value))' omitting the quotes.  

- Class: text
  Output: Third, make new labels for the boxplot from the names of 'ar.value'.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Make a new character vector of labels by entering 'study.labels <- 
    substr(names(ar.value), start=1, stop=15)'.
  CorrectAnswer: study.labels <- substr(names(ar.value), start=1, stop=15)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='study.labels <- substr(names(ar.value), start=1, stop=15)')
  Hint: Enter 'study.labels <- substr(names(ar.value), start=1, stop=15)' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'boxplot(ar.exp$Value ~ ar.exp$Cancer.Study, names=study.labels, col=study.cols, las=2, main="AR Expression Across Cancer Studies")' 
    to make a  revised boxplot of AR expression values across all cancer studies.
  CorrectAnswer: boxplot(ar.exp$Value ~ ar.exp$Cancer.Study, names=study.labels, col=study.cols, las=2, main="AR Expression Across Cancer Studies")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='boxplot(ar.exp$Value ~ ar.exp$Cancer.Study, names=study.labels, col=study.cols, las=2, main="AR Expression Across Cancer Studies")')
  Hint: Enter 'boxplot(ar.exp$Value ~ ar.exp$Cancer.Study, names=study.labels, col=study.cols, las=2, cex=0.8, main="AR Expression Across Cancer Studies")' omitting the quotes.  

- Class: text
  Output: This is an informative boxplot, suggesting that high AR 
    expression is associated with specific cancers.  There is certainly enough 
    published literature to support this idea.  

- Class: text
  Output: We could do more to explore 'ar.value' using the numerous 
    functions that work on data frames, but this lesson is intended only as 
    an introduction.  

- Class: text
  Output: Two more tasks are critical for working with data frames, 1) saving a 
    data frame to a text file and 2) reading a text file into R as a data 
    frame.

- Class: text
  Output: When this lesson started, the data frame 'ar.exp' was created from 
    a text file that you downloaded and installed with the swirl course.  
    That file is "buried" in all the supporting files for R, and the location 
    depends on your computer.  

- Class: text
  Output: Now, we can write 'ar.exp' to your current working directory (the 
    location on your computer where are reads and writes files).  Then, we 
    can read the file back into R.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'list.files()' to show the files in your current working directory.
  CorrectAnswer: list.files()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='list.files()')
  Hint: Enter 'list.files()' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: It is not important how many files you have in your directory, but 
    we will use this function again to confirm that you have written 'ar.exp' 
    to a file.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter '?write.table' to go to the help page for 'write.table()'.
  CorrectAnswer: ?write.table
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='?write.table')
  Hint: Enter '?write.table' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: There are six parameters that you generally want to pass to 
    'write.table()', x = object name you want to save, file = file name, 
    quote = do you want quotes around characters and factors, sep = character 
    that separates the fields/columns of data in your text file, 
    row.names = do you want to write the R row names to the file, and 
    col.names = do you want to write the R column names to the file.

- Class: text
  Output: The parameters x and file have no defaults so these must be provided.  

- Class: text
  Output: For bioinformatics data, you likely want 'quote=FALSE' because quotes 
    around characters strings and factors are generally not necessary.

- Class: text
  Output: For bioinformatics data, the most common field separator is a tab 
    because commas, spaces, and other characters occur frequently in the data 
    itself.  In R, a tab is represented as "\t".

- Class: text
  Output: There may be cases when you want to include the R row names because 
    the row names can be an integral part of the data.  For 'ar.exp', the 
    row names are simply numbers, so we don't need them.

- Class: text
  Output: Generally, you want to include the column names.  However, for some 
    common file formats in bioinformatics, such as BED and GFF files, the 
    column names are standard, and the column names must be omitted to allow 
    common bioinformatics software to read the file.  For 'ar.exp', we want 
    to keep the column names.  

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'write.table(ar.exp, file="AR_Expression.txt", quote=FALSE, sep="\t", row.names=FALSE, col.names=TRUE)' 
    to save a text file version of 'ar.exp' to your working directory.
  CorrectAnswer: write.table(ar.exp, file="AR_Expression.txt", quote=FALSE, sep="\t", row.names=FALSE, col.names=TRUE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='write.table(ar.exp, file="AR_Expression.txt", quote=FALSE, sep="\t", row.names=FALSE, col.names=TRUE)')
  Hint: Enter 'write.table(ar.exp, file="AR_Expression.txt", quote=FALSE, sep="\t", row.names=FALSE, col.names=TRUE)' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Confirm that you have created "AR_Expression.txt" by entering 'list.files()' 
    to show the files in your current working directory.
  CorrectAnswer: list.files()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='list.files()')
  Hint: Enter 'list.files()' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: You should see "AR_Expression.txt" in your working directory.  
    This is a standard text file that can be opened with many programs such 
    as NotePad, TextWrangler, Word and Excel.  

- Class: text
  Output: Now, we are simply going to read the file into R as a data frame 
    with the function 'read.delim()' and compare it to 'ar.exp'.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter '?read.delim' to go to the help page for 'Data Input'.
  CorrectAnswer: ?read.delim
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='?read.delim')
  Hint: Enter '?read.delim' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: This help page covers, five functions.  Four of these are really 
    versions of 'read.table()' with different default parameters.  For our 
    file, 'read.delim()' will work fine because the default parameters are 
    correct for "AR_Expression.txt", 'header=TRUE' and 'sep="\t"'.

- Class: text
  Output: However, there is one major issue to address that is peculiar to 
    R, the conversion of character strings to factors.  By default, R will 
    do this conversion even when it does not make sense, e.g. unique sample 
    names are not factors.  Further, for large files, this conversion can 
    take a long time.  

- Class: text
  Output: There are two parameters that can be used to suppress this behavior, 
    'as.is=TRUE' and 'stringsAsFactors=FALSE'.  With 'read.delim()', 'as.is=TRUE' 
    works fine.  With certain other functions such as 'data.frame()', it 
    is necessary to use 'stringsAsFactors=FALSE'.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'ar.exp2 <- read.delim(file="AR_Expression.txt", as.is=TRUE)' to go to the help page for 'Data Input'.
  CorrectAnswer: ar.exp2 <- read.delim(file="AR_Expression.txt", as.is=TRUE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='ar.exp2 <- read.delim(file="AR_Expression.txt", as.is=TRUE)')
  Hint: Enter 'ar.exp2 <- read.delim(file="AR_Expression.txt", as.is=TRUE)' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'head(ar.exp2, 10)' to display the first 10 rows of ar.exp2.
  CorrectAnswer: head(ar.exp2, 10)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='head(ar.exp2, 10)')
  Hint: Enter 'head(ar.exp2, 10)' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: Do you think that 'ar.exp' and 'ar.exp2' are identical?  We can 
    check this with the 'identical()' function.  

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'identical(ar.exp, ar.exp2)' to display the first 10 rows of ar.exp2.
  CorrectAnswer: identical(ar.exp, ar.exp2)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='identical(ar.exp, ar.exp2)')
  Hint: Enter 'identical(ar.exp, ar.exp2)' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: The answer is no because 'ar.exp$Cancer.Study' is a factor, while 
    'ar.exp2$Cancer.Study' is still character because of the way we read in 
    the data.  This is easy to fix.  

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'ar.exp2$Cancer.Study <- factor(ar.exp2$Cancer.Study, levels=names(ar.value))'.
  CorrectAnswer: ar.exp2$Cancer.Study <- factor(ar.exp2$Cancer.Study, levels=names(ar.value))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='ar.exp2$Cancer.Study <- factor(ar.exp2$Cancer.Study, levels=names(ar.value))')
  Hint: Enter 'ar.exp2$Cancer.Study <- factor(ar.exp2$Cancer.Study, levels=names(ar.value))' omitting the quotes.  

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'identical(ar.exp, ar.exp2)' to display the first 10 rows of ar.exp2.
  CorrectAnswer: identical(ar.exp, ar.exp2)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='identical(ar.exp, ar.exp2)')
  Hint: Enter 'identical(ar.exp, ar.exp2)' exactly but omit the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: This completes Lesson 03.  A short quiz follows.  Use the help 
    menu or try various answers as much as you need to.  There is no penalty 
    for incorrect answers, but you must find the correct answer before you 
    can proceed.  

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which variable in 'ar.exp' would be the most useful factor?
  CorrectAnswer: Mutation
  AnswerChoices: Mutation; Profile.Name; Gene
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Mutation')
  Hint: How many possible values does each variable have?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: How many samples in 'ar.exp' have a 'Value' of less than zero?
  CorrectAnswer: 965
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='965')
  Hint: You might want to make a table of a logical vector.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output:  How many samples have the Q58L mutation?
  CorrectAnswer: 8
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='8')
  Hint: You might want to make a table.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Write the expression that would extract the 'Cancer.Study' with 
    the "Q58L" 'Mutation'.  Use the following operators in your expression 
    '$', '[]' and '=='.  Remember that "Q58L" is a character string and must 
    be enclosed by quotes.
  CorrectAnswer: ar.exp$Cancer.Study[ar.exp$Mutation == "Q58L"]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='ar.exp$Cancer.Study[ar.exp$Mutation == "Q58L"]')
  Hint: You should use '$' twice, one set of square brackets, and one double 
    equals sign.

- Class: text
  Output: You have completed Lesson 03.  Now you need to write the completion 
    key to "lessonKeys.txt".  Since the file already exists and contains 
    information we need to preserve, we will use 'append=TRUE' as an argument.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter 'write("Lesson03_JVEZM", file="~/BigTapSwirl/lessonKeys.txt", append=TRUE)' to append 
    the key for lesson02 to the file "lessonKeys.txt".
  CorrectAnswer: write("Lesson03_JVEZM", file="~/BigTapSwirl/lessonKeys.txt", append=TRUE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExp='write("Lesson03_JVEZM", file="~/BigTapSwirl/lessonKeys.txt", append=TRUE)')
  Hint: Enter 'write("Lesson03_JVEZM", file="~/BigTapSwirl/lessonKeys.txt", append=TRUE)' omitting the quotes.

- Class: text
  Output: If you could not create "lessonKeys.txt", please copy and paste the 
    key into a Word or text document.
